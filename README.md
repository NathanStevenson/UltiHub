# UltiHub
Premier Ultimate Frisbee Management Portal built using Django, hosted by Vercel, and UI developed using Figma.

## Future Plans
1. Design the UI using Figma. Include the base landing page, password protected portal, adding new teams form, 
customizable team landing page, default landing page includes: tournament schedule, roster, playbook, settings. Optional add-ons:
film, team discussion, workouts.

2. Host a default Django app on Vercel with hot reloading

3. Begin coding the project. Stages described below:
    - Code the default landing page (has our logo and asks you to search for your team)
    - Code the process of adding a new team via a form. Necessary stuff (team name, point of contacts email, team password, team logo)
    - Code the default landing home page for the team
    - Implement each of the above features and UI described and allow teams to customize their default landing page
    - Use Night Train guys to help test and see if they have any feedback about what to add

4. After thorough testing release to the public (if really flushed out look into payment gate services ($10 a year))
