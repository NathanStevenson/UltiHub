### Future Plans
1. Design the UI using Figma. Include the base landing page, password protected portal, adding new teams form, 
customizable team landing page, default landing page includes: important upcoming dates, team logistics/practice plans, playbook, roster, settings. Optional add-ons:
film, team discussion, workouts.

2. Host a default Django app on Vercel with hot reloading

3. Begin coding the project. Stages described below:
    - Code the default landing page (has our logo and asks you to search for your team)
    - Code the process of adding a new team via a form. Necessary stuff (team name, point of contacts email, team password, team logo)
    - Code the default landing home page for the team
    - Users can customize their profile (show what teams they have played for in the past, favorite workout, favorite frisbee throw, profile photo)
    - Include the settings menu can click on their profile photo (if admin can add new stuff to team landing page, else edit profile, contact page, about us page)
    - Implement each of the above features and UI described and allow teams to customize their default landing page
    - Use Night Train guys to help test and see if they have any feedback about what to add

4. After thorough testing release to the public (if really flushed out look into payment gate services ($10 a year))
